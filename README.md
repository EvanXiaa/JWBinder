# JWBinder

~~The author will release the code before December 25th~~

The current version provides a proof-of-concept of JWBinder. The author will update manual instructions after a few days.

## Structure

*code* folder contains our implementation of JWBinder

*data* folder contains the malware/benignware dataset for our evaluation.

## Important 

~~1. We will release our code upon the paper is accepted.~~ Done :)

2. We are not able to release the complete data due to the **privacy policy** of VirusTotal. So we exclude malware from VirusTotal dataset.
